# NLP Processing with Colab

## Overview
This project demonstrates various NLP techniques using a Jupyter notebook in Google Colab. It processes a dataset of text-based questions and outputs a refined version.

## Files Included
- `NLP_Techniques.ipynb` - A Colab notebook implementing NLP preprocessing techniques.
- `data.csv` - The raw dataset containing text-based questions.  
- `processed_questions.csv` - The processed output after NLP transformations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook)
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `nltk`, `spacy`, `sklearn`, etc.

### How to Use
1. Open `NLP_Techniques.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload `data.csv` or modify the path to load it.
3. Run the notebook cells to process the data.
4. The output is saved as `processed_questions.csv`.

## Installation
To run locally, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk spacy scikit-learn
```

## Results
The processed dataset contains cleaned and tokenized text, making it ready for further NLP tasks like classification or clustering.
